import { ComponentPublicInstance } from 'react';

// This function seems to be designed for Vue.js component instance (vm)
// and checking if a component is registered within its application context.
// It's not directly applicable to React components.

// In React, component registration and availability are handled differently
// through imports and JSX usage.

// If you are trying to achieve something similar in React, you might be looking at:
// 1. Checking if a component has been imported.
// 2. Checking if a component is present in a specific context or provider.

// Here's a placeholder function that indicates it's not directly translatable to React:
export default function isComponentRegisteredInReact(
  vm: ComponentPublicInstance, // This type is from Vue and doesn't directly apply to React
  component: string
): boolean {
  console.warn(
    "This function seems to be designed for Vue.js and is not directly applicable to React's component registration mechanism."
  );
  return false; // Or you could throw an error to indicate incompatibility
}

// Explanation of why the original logic doesn't fit React:

// 1. `vm.appContext`: This property is specific to Vue 3's application context. React components don't have this structure.

// 2. `vm.appContext.app.component(component)`: This is a Vue 3 API for accessing globally registered components within a Vue application. React doesn't have a central global component registry in the same way. Components are typically imported and used directly in JSX.

// 3. `vm.proxy.$root.$options.components`: This pattern is common in Vue 2 for accessing the root component's options, which might include globally or locally registered components. React doesn't have a direct equivalent to `$root.$options.components`. Component composition in React relies on importing and rendering child components.

// How to check component availability in React:

// - Import Check: The most basic way is to ensure the component file has been imported into the file where you want to use it. The TypeScript compiler will help with this by checking for unresolved imports.

// - Context/Providers: If you are using React's Context API or a third-party state management library with a provider pattern, you might check if a specific component or related data is available within the context.

// Example of a conceptual check using Context (this is just an illustration):

// import React, { useContext } from 'react';
// import { MyComponentsContext } from './MyComponentsContext';
//
// export default function isComponentAvailableInContext(componentName: string): boolean {
//   const context = useContext(MyComponentsContext);
//   return context && context[componentName] !== undefined;
// }

// In summary, the provided Vue.js function has no direct equivalent in React due to the fundamental differences in how components are registered and managed in the two frameworks. You'll need to use React-specific patterns to check for component availability.
